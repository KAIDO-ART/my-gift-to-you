            <p>
                Just as i clicked this empty page open,
                I had a whole lot to write but as the page opened and stared
                back at me it felt like everything wiped off my brain.
                Anyway, I'm still as excited for your birthday as i was last 
                year. I hope this year feels a little bit less lonely <br>
                I did a whole lot of countdowns and really looked forward to today,
                for some reason it felt like an eternityy (probably cause events changed
                and it's not happening exactly the way i wanted it to). <br>
                Nevertheless, this is for you, the kind man who did a good job at always being
                fun and amazing at the same time. As i'll always do back then even though
                your universe might not be my universe, I'll always pray for you
                sincerely. <br>
                Thank you for giving me the happiness i'm yet to find in someone else. For
                being a friend, a hype man, a supporter and a good man in so many of
                my pages. Thank you for unrelentingly requiting my love in greate folds
                than i could've ever imagined. <br>
                May so much goodness await you in every page that is left for you.
